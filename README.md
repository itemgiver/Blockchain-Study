## About

I learned what problems can occur in a single machine and a distributed system when there are large-scale transactions. Also, I learned how to solve them theoretically.

System Failures - Undo / Redo logging, Checkpointing \
Concurrency Control - Locking System (shared lock, exclusive lock, update lock), Timestamps, Validation

Lastly, I implemented a blockchain toy project and a simple hyperledger fabric code with Go.
